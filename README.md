Terrain and Road Network Analysis for Chamoli District
This repository contains code and results for analyzing the road network and terrain of Chamoli District, India. The analysis focuses on evaluating the existing road network, computing shortest paths, assessing slopes, and determining the feasibility of new road connections based on distance criteria.

Overview
The project involves several key components:

Downloading and Processing Road Network: Fetches and processes road network data for the specified region.
Network Visualization: Creates visualizations of the road network and distribution of road lengths.
Network Analysis: Computes various network metrics, including centrality measures.
Slope Calculation: Calculates slopes of road segments based on altitude differences and distances.
Feasibility Assessment: Determines whether new road connections are feasible based on a distance threshold of 20 km.
Tech Stack
Python: Core language for data processing and analysis.
OSMnx: Extracts and processes road network data from OpenStreetMap.
NetworkX: Analyzes and computes shortest paths in the network.
Pandas: Manages data manipulation and exports results to CSV files.
Requests: Fetches data from Google APIs for altitude and distance calculations.
Matplotlib: Visualizes road networks and distributions.
FPDF: Generates PDF reports.
NumPy: Provides numerical operations.
Seaborn: Enhances data visualization.
Setup
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install osmnx networkx matplotlib pandas requests numpy fpdf seaborn
Google API Keys: Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual Google API keys for Elevation and Distance Matrix APIs.

CSV File: Prepare a CSV file with latitude and longitude columns. Update the file path in the code to point to your CSV file.
